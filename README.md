# Flores-Haddad-Dolan_et-al.

This repository contains all of the scripts used in the data acquisition and anlysis of the molecular dynamics (MD) data presented in *Flores, Haddad, Dolan, et al.*

All of the Scripts in this repository were developed by Bassam Haddad with the exception of:
  
  math.tcl
  matrix.tcl
  
  As these are standard TCL libraries that were downloaded to be used in LipNetwork.tcl
